# calendar-frontend — Task List

Last updated: 2026-04-04 (Phase 3.3 product gaps written down)

> **Rule:** When you complete a task, change `- [ ]` to `- [x]` and move it to the Done section.
> **Legend:** `[ ]` Not started · `[~]` Has code but broken/incomplete · `[x]` Done and working

> **Naming:** "Action Items" is now **"Tasks"** everywhere in the UI.

## P0 — Build Next (in order)

### 1. Auth — Refresh Token

- [x] Axios interceptor — on 401, auto-call `POST /auth/refresh`, retry original request

- [x] Delete note (with confirm)
- [x] Show notes with timestamp
- [x] React Query hook: `useNotes(meetingId)`
- [x] Service: notes methods in `smaService.ts` (getAll, create, delete)
- [x] Query keys: `queryKeys.sma.notes(meetingId)`

### 3. Tasks UI

Requires backend `Task` model + CRUD API to be built first.

- [x] Rename all "Action Items" labels to "Tasks" everywhere in the UI
- [x] Mark task complete / incomplete (toggle checkbox, optimistic update)
- [x] Create task manually (inline form — just title, press Enter)

- [x] ⋯ menu with "Copy tasks" — copies all tasks as a formatted checklist to clipboard
- [x] Tasks section present in all 3 layouts (VoiceNoteDetail, RecordedDetail, ScheduledDetail)
- [x] Service: task methods in `smaService.ts` (getAll, create, update, delete)
- [x] Query keys: `queryKeys.sma.tasks(meetingId)`

### 4. Edit Meeting Modal

- [x] SCHEDULED only — edit title, description, startTime, endTime, location
- [x] Open from ScheduledDetail Edit button (quick actions area)
- [x] Validates time conflicts on save (client-side + ApiError 409 from backend)
- [x] Invalidates meeting cache on success

### 5. Delete Meeting

- [x] Confirm dialog before delete ("Delete this meeting? This can't be undone.")
- [x] Wire Delete in VoiceNoteDetail ⋯ menu

## UX & Polish — Discovered Issues

### 17. Meeting List UX — Single Click to Navigate

Currently: click → card expands → click "Open" to navigate (two clicks).
Fix: click anywhere on card → navigate to meeting detail. Context menu (⋯) stays for actions.

- [x] Remove `expandedId` state and expand/collapse behavior
- [x] Card `onClick` → `navigate(/meetings/:id)` directly
- [x] Move context menu (⋯) to always-visible right side of card (stop-propagation on click)
- [x] For RECORDED meetings: ⋯ menu only has "Open" + "Delete" (no accept/decline)
- [x] For SCHEDULED meetings: ⋯ menu retains accept/decline/complete/cancel

### 18. RECORDED Meeting Status Badge

Currently: RECORDED meetings show "Created" badge — meaningless for recordings.
Fix: hide the status badge for RECORDED meetings. The Video icon + transcription status icons are enough.

- [x] In Meetings.tsx, only render the status badge when `meeting.meetingType === 'SCHEDULED'`
- [x] Ensure RECORDED card still looks complete without the badge

### 19. Tags on Voice Notes Listing

Currently: Voice Notes page shows no tags.
Fix: show tag chips on each voice note row + tag filter at top (same pattern as Meetings page).

- [x] Fetch user tags (`useUserTags`) in VoiceNotes page
- [x] Tag filter bar (same chip UI as Meetings)
- [x] Tag chips on each voice note row (above meta row)
- [x] Filter logic: only show notes that have any of the selected tags
- [x] Note: tags on VOICE_NOTE meetings are stored via `MeetingTag` — backend already supports this

### 20. Tags on Cards Listing + Dashboard Tag Edit

Currently: Cards list doesn't show tags. No way to add/remove tags from a card in the dashboard.
Backend already has `GET/POST/DELETE /cards/:cardId/tags` + `CardTag` junction.

- [x] Tag chips on each card row in Cards list
- [x] Tag filter bar on Cards list (same chip UI)
- [x] Tag editor on Card detail/editor page — add/remove tags inline (same popover pattern as MeetingDetail TagsSection)
- [x] Use existing `queryKeys.tags.byCard(cardId)` key + backend tag endpoints

### 21. Hover Jitter Fix

Currently: meeting cards use `transition-all` which causes jitter/paint issues on hover.

- [x] Replace `transition-all duration-200` with `transition-[border-color,box-shadow] duration-200` on meeting cards (Meetings.tsx)
- [x] Same fix on VoiceNotes.tsx cards and any other list cards using `transition-all`
- [x] Test in both light and dark mode

### 22. Ask AI Persistence (Deferred)

Deferred until Ask AI becomes universal (Phase 2 Big Brain). Skip for now.

## Phase 1.2 — Scheduling & Online Meetings ← current

Design doc: `docs/dev-notes/phase-1.2-scheduling.md`

Depends on: backend P0 (UserSettings API) must exist before building settings UI.

### P0 — Settings Page Restructure

- [x] **Settings page skeleton:** Restructure `/settings` into tabbed sections: Profile | Scheduling | Event Types | Availability | Integrations | AI & Transcription | Privacy. URL-based tabs (`?tab=scheduling`, etc.). Grouped sidebar + mobile pill bar.
- [x] **Scheduling settings section:** Master on/off toggle, min notice hours (number input), max window days, default buffer mins. Wire to `PATCH /settings/user`. Skeleton + optimistic update.
- [x] **AI & Transcription settings section:** Auto-transcribe toggle, auto-AI toggle, default language selector (dropdown, BCP-47). Wire to `PATCH /settings/user`.

### P1 — Event Types + Availability UI

- [x] **Event types section:** List event type cards (title, duration, locationType badge, active toggle). "New event type" button. Edit + delete. React Query hooks: `useEventTypes`, `useCreateEventType`, `useUpdateEventType`, `useDeleteEventType`. Wire to `/scheduling/event-types` endpoints. Optimistic active toggle.
- [x] **Event type form (slide-over/dialog):** Fields: title, slug (auto-derived, editable), duration (15/30/45/60/90 min select), locationType (IN_PERSON | ONLINE), meeting link (ONLINE only), buffer before/after, max per day. Client-side validation. Error + loading + empty states.
- [x] **Availability weekly grid:** 7-row grid (Sun–Sat). Each row: day label + on/off toggle + time range inputs. Disabled when off. "Reset to defaults" button. Wire to `GET/PATCH /scheduling/availability`.
- [x] **Availability overrides:** Date picker to block specific dates. Blocked dates shown as removable chips. Wire to `POST/DELETE /scheduling/availability/overrides`.

### P3 — Google Calendar Settings

- [x] **Google Calendar integration section:** Connected state (email badge + sync toggle) vs unconnected (disabled connect button + note). `googleCalendarSyncEnabled` toggle wired to `PATCH /settings/user`. Connect button pending backend P3 OAuth.

### P4 — Recall.ai Settings

- [x] **Recall.ai integration section:** API key input (password-masked, show/hide toggle) wired to `PUT /settings/recall-api-key`. `recallEnabled` toggle wired to `PATCH /settings/user`. "API key saved" confirmation after save. Instructional link to app.recall.ai.

---

---

## Phase 1.3 — Google Calendar Deep Integration

Design doc: `docs/dev-notes/phase-1.3-gcal.md`

> **What already exists from Phase 1.2:**
>
> - Settings > Integrations > Google Calendar section — connect button + `googleCalendarSyncEnabled` toggle (skeleton wired)
> - `PATCH /settings/user` wired for sync toggle

### P0 — Types + Service Layer

- [x] Add `CalendarEvent` type to `src/services/integrationsService.ts` (types live in service file, not a separate integrations.ts)
- [x] Add `meetLink?: string | null` to `Meeting` type in `src/types/meeting.ts`
- [x] `googleEventId?: string` already existed in Meeting type
- [x] `src/services/integrationsService.ts` — `getGoogleCalendarStatus()` + `getGoogleCalendarEvents(start, end)` + `CalendarEvent` + `GCalConnectionStatus` types
- [x] Query keys: `queryKeys.integrations.google.status()`, `queryKeys.integrations.google.events(start, end)` in `src/lib/queryKeys.ts` (replaced legacy `queryKeys.sync`)
- [x] `useGoogleCalendarStatus()` + `useGoogleCalendarEvents(start, end)` hooks in `src/hooks/queries/useIntegrationQueries.ts`

### P1 — Meet Link UX in Meeting Detail

- [x] **ScheduledDetail:** When `meeting.meetLink` is set → "Join Meeting" button (primary) + copy icon button in quick-actions area
- [x] **RecordedDetail + VoiceNoteDetail:** Inline "Join meeting →" link in header when meetLink present
- [x] Meeting creation form: "Add to Google Calendar with a Meet link" switch (shown only if GCal connected, on by default). Passes `addToCalendar: true` to backend.

### P2 — Unified Timeline on Home Dashboard

- [x] **`TodayTimeline` component** (`src/pages/home/TodayTimeline.tsx`) — replaces the "Today's meetings" widget. Shows Crelyzor meetings + GCal events for today in a chronological unified list.
  - Crelyzor meetings: same card style, navigates to /meetings/:id
  - GCal events: muted bg, CalendarDays icon, "Google Calendar" label — clickable when meetLink present, display-only otherwise
  - Empty state: "No events today"
  - Loading: skeleton rows (waits for both queries)
  - Gated behind gcalStatus?.connected — no API call for disconnected users
- [x] Wired into Home dashboard replacing TodaysMeetings
- [x] GCal events are display-only — no ⋯ menu, no AI actions. Non-interactive div when no meetLink.

### P3 — Settings > Integrations Wiring

- [x] **Google Calendar status:** `useGoogleCalendarStatus()` wired in `IntegrationsSection`. Shows connected email badge or "Not connected" state. Live data from `GET /integrations/google/status`. Replaces static skeleton.
- [x] **Connect flow:** "Connect Google Calendar" button already wired from Phase 1.2. On OAuth return, `queryKeys.integrations.google.status()` + `queryKeys.settings.all` both invalidated so UI refreshes.
- [x] **Disconnect:** `useDisconnectGoogleCalendar` mutation wired. Ghost "Disconnect" button next to email badge. Calls `DELETE /integrations/google/disconnect`, invalidates status + settings caches, shows toast.
- [x] **Sync toggle:** `googleCalendarSyncEnabled` wired via `PATCH /settings/user`. Inline `onSuccess`/`onError` toast feedback added.

## Phase 1.4 — Recall.ai Platform Integration ✅ Complete

Design doc: `docs/dev-notes/phase-1.4-recall-platform.md`

Simplify Settings > Integrations — remove API key management, keep toggle.

### P0 — Types + services cleanup

- [x] Replace `hasRecallApiKey` with `recallAvailable: boolean` in `UserSettings` type
- [x] Remove `settingsApi.saveRecallApiKey()` from `settingsService.ts`
- [x] Remove `useSaveRecallApiKey` hook from `useSettingsQueries.ts`

### P1 — Settings UI simplification

- [x] Remove API key input, save button, show/hide toggle, "API key saved" badge
- [x] Toggle shown only when `settings.recallAvailable === true`
- [x] Disabled state: "Recording bot not available on this instance" when `!recallAvailable`
- [x] Label: "Auto-record online meetings" (vendor name hidden)
- [x] Card title: "Meeting Recording Bot"
- [x] Removed unused `Eye`/`EyeOff` icon imports

---

## Phase 2 — Standalone Tasks

- [x] Standalone Tasks page (Todoist-style — filter chips, sort bar, inline create, toggle complete)
- [x] Task filters: by status, priority, source + sort by createdAt/dueDate/priority
- [x] Tags on Tasks (tag chips on task rows + tag filter bar, extends universal Tag system)

---

## Phase 3 — Todoist-Level Tasks + Calendar View

Full design doc: `docs/dev-notes/phase-3-tasks-calendar.md`

### P0 — Backend schema done ✅ (crelyzor-backend)

### P1 — Task Detail Panel + Row Redesign ✅

- [x] Task detail slide-over panel (right side, stays open alongside list)
  - Inline-editable title, description
  - Due date picker
  - Priority selector, status toggle (TODO/IN_PROGRESS/DONE)
  - Tags multi-select, linked meeting chip
  - Subtasks list with inline add
- [x] Task row redesign
  - Left priority border (red HIGH, amber MEDIUM)
  - Due date turns red + "Overdue" when past due
  - Meeting chip (click → navigate)
  - Click row → opens detail panel

### P2 — Sidebar Nav + Views ✅

- [x] Sidebar nav within /tasks: Inbox · Today · Upcoming · All · From Meetings
- [x] Today view — overdue at top + due today below, section headers
- [x] Upcoming view — 7 days, grouped under date headers
- [x] From Meetings view — tasks grouped by meeting name

### P3 — Board View + Drag and Drop

- [x] View toggle: List / Board (inbox + all views)
- [x] Board view — 3 Kanban columns (Todo / In Progress / Done), drag between columns
- [x] List drag-to-reorder — dnd-kit, persists via PATCH /sma/tasks/reorder (inbox view only)
- [x] Grouped view — Overdue / Today / Tomorrow / This Week / Later / No Date

### P4 — Global Quick-Add

- [x] Cmd+K quick-add from anywhere — natural language parsing (priority, due date, tags)
- [x] Contact-linked tasks on Card detail page

### P5 — Calendar Page

- [x] Tasks with `scheduledTime` appear on `TodayTimeline` as timed items
- [x] Tasks with only `dueDate` appear as "Due today" section at top of timeline
- [x] Toggle task complete directly from timeline
- [x] /calendar page — week/day view (GCal events + Crelyzor meetings + Tasks)
- [x] All-day task markers for dueDate-only tasks
- [x] Drag task to calendar time slot → sets scheduledTime

---

## Phase 3.2 — Polish, Enhancements & Power Features ← current

### P0 — Bugs & Embarrassing Gaps

- [x] **Fix "Reschedule meeting" button** (`ScheduledDetail`) — `RescheduleMeetingModal` with start + end datetime-local inputs, calls `PATCH /meetings/:id`, handles 409 conflict.
- [x] **Privacy Settings tab** — removed from Settings nav (was an empty placeholder). Rebuild properly in a future phase.

---

### P1 — Quick Wins

- [x] **Task count badges in sidebar nav** — live counts next to Inbox · Today · Upcoming. Badge query: `{ status: 'pending', limit: 500 }`, counts derived client-side. Upcoming capped to 7-day window to match backend view.

- [x] **Overdue tasks on home dashboard** — `OverdueTasksSection` above TodayTimeline. Shows up to 3 rows with neutral left border + count badge. Hidden when zero overdue. Overdue tasks excluded from todayTasks and otherTasks buckets.

- [x] **NL parsing in inline task create form** — `parseTaskInput` wired into handleCreate and live preview chips shown below input. PRIORITY_STYLES + PRIORITY_LABELS extracted to `src/constants/task.ts` (shared with CommandPalette).

- [x] **Task duration picker in detail panel** — `TaskDetailPanel`: add a "Duration" field below Due Date. Options: 15 / 30 / 45 / 60 / 90 / 120 min (select or segmented control). On change calls `updateTask({ durationMinutes })`. Requires `durationMinutes` backend field (P1 backend task).

- [x] **Calendar renders task duration correctly** — `CalendarGrid.tsx`: change the hardcoded `30 * 60 * 1000` end time for tasks to use `task.durationMinutes ?? 30`. `getChipPosition` already uses `endMs` so height auto-adjusts.

- [x] **Jump-to-date on calendar** — clicking the `"Apr 2 – Apr 8"` / `"Wednesday, April 2"` header label opens a small date-picker popover. Selecting a date sets `anchor` to the Monday of that week (week mode) or that exact date (day mode). Use a simple `<input type="date">` inside a popover or the shadcn Popover + Calendar component.

- [x] **Email signature generator** — new tab/section in `CardEditor` (or a standalone modal triggered from the card actions menu). Renders an HTML email signature from the card data (name, title, email, phone, card URL + QR code as inline image). Two outputs: (1) Copy HTML button (for Gmail/Outlook paste), (2) Copy plain text fallback. No backend needed — pure client-side render.

---

### P2 — Meaningful Features

- [x] **"New tasks from meeting" badge on home dashboard** — after a meeting's AI processing completes (`transcriptionStatus = COMPLETED`), surface a callout on the home page: _"X new tasks extracted from [meeting title]"_ with a link to that meeting's tasks. Implementation: `useAllTasks({ source: 'AI_EXTRACTED', status: 'pending' })` — check for tasks created in the last 24h. Show as a dismissible banner above the timeline. Dismiss stores meeting IDs in `localStorage`.

- [x] **Task bulk actions** — "Select" toggle in header (list mode only), checkbox on each task row in select mode, floating `BulkActionBar` with bulk complete / priority / delete. Escape or Cancel button exits. Uses `smaApi` in `Promise.all` with single `invalidateQueries` after.

- [x] **Card analytics improvement** — `CardAnalytics` page: pure SVG sparkline of daily views, trend indicator (TrendingUp/Down/Minus) on Total Views KPI, link click breakdown with progress bars, top countries with progress bars. No external chart deps. All colors neutral palette only.

- [x] **Onboarding flow for new users** — localStorage-gated overlay on Home for users with 0 cards + 0 meetings. Shows 3 action rows (Create card / Go to meetings / Connect calendar) with individual navigate buttons. "I'm all set" dismisses permanently. No wizard — single-view checklist. Guards against flash via loading state checks.

---

### P3 — Bigger Features

- [x] **Global search UI** — `/search?q=` page with 4 result sections (Meetings / Tasks / Cards / Contacts), 300ms debounce, `keepPreviousData`, skeleton + empty state. Route registered in App.tsx.

- [x] **Calendar month view** — "Month" added to toggle (left of Week/Day). 6-week grid, Monday-first. Each cell: day number (today highlighted), meeting chips (up to 2 + overflow), GCal dots (up to 3), task count badge. Clicking any cell switches to day view. Out-of-month days dimmed.

- [x] **Keyboard shortcuts** — J/K navigate, Enter opens panel, E edits title, D opens due-date picker, P cycles priority, Space toggles complete, Del deletes, Esc closes/deselects. `?` shortcut + footer button toggles a fixed-position shortcuts cheatsheet panel. Inbox+list excluded (DnD keyboard sensor conflict). `autoFocusField` prop on `TaskDetailPanel` triggers title focus or label `.click()` for due date.

- [ ] **Schedule task → create GCal block** — in `TaskDetailPanel`: when `scheduledTime` is set and user has GCal connected, show a toggle _"Block time in Google Calendar"_ (default off). When enabled, calls `updateTask({ scheduledTime, blockInCalendar: true })`. Backend creates a GCal event. Show the GCal event ID as a small chip "Blocked in calendar ✓" when set. Requires backend P3 task.

- [ ] **Meeting ↔ Card contact chips** — in `ScheduledDetail` participants section: when a participant's `card` field is populated (from backend auto-linking), show their card chip (avatar + name, clickable → `/cards/:cardId/edit`). On `CardEditor` contacts section: show a "Meetings" count chip per contact that opens a meeting list filtered by that contact. Requires backend P3 task.

---

### P4 — Major Feature

- [ ] **Recurring task UI** — in `TaskDetailPanel`: add a "Repeat" field (below Due Date). Options: None / Daily / Weekly / Monthly / Custom. For Weekly: show day-of-week selector. Stores as RRULE string via `updateTask({ recurringRule })`. Completed recurring tasks show "Next occurrence: [date]" instead of disappearing. Requires backend P4 task.

---

## Phase 3.3 — Close the Product Gaps

> Identified via full user-perspective product review (2026-04-04).

---

### P1 — Email Notification Preferences (Settings UI)

- [ ] **Settings > Notifications tab** — new tab in Settings page (after Integrations). Show toggles for:
  - Email notifications master toggle (`emailNotificationsEnabled`)
  - Booking emails (`bookingEmailsEnabled`) — "Get an email when someone books you"
  - Meeting ready (`meetingReadyEmailEnabled`) — "Get an email when AI finishes processing"
  - Daily task digest (`dailyDigestEnabled`) — "Daily summary of tasks at 8am" (off by default)
- [ ] Wire to `PATCH /settings/user` — same pattern as existing settings toggles

---

### P2 — Scheduling Completeness (EventType Editor)

The backend already supports these fields — we just need to expose them in the UI.

- [ ] **EventType editor: Minimum notice** — add "Minimum notice" field (hours before booking). Dropdown: None / 1h / 2h / 4h / 12h / 24h / 48h. Maps to `minNoticeHours` on EventType.
- [ ] **EventType editor: Buffer time** — add "Buffer before" + "Buffer after" dropdowns (0 / 5 / 10 / 15 / 30 min). Maps to `bufferBefore` / `bufferAfter` on EventType.
- [ ] **EventType editor: Max bookings/day** — add "Max per day" number input (blank = unlimited). Maps to `maxPerDay` on EventType.
- [ ] **Bookings list: Cancelled state** — show cancelled bookings with a strikethrough + "Cancelled" badge. Currently only active bookings shown.

---

### P3 — Connection Features

- [ ] **Ask AI — meeting list shortcut** — add a small "Ask AI" ghost button on each meeting row in the meetings list (appears on hover). Clicking navigates to `/meetings/:id#ask-ai` and auto-opens the Ask AI panel. Makes the feature discoverable without drilling into the meeting.
- [ ] **Ask AI — home dashboard** — add "Ask about your meetings" as an action in the home quick-actions or a subtle prompt on the TodayTimeline when meetings exist with transcripts.
- [ ] **Meeting ↔ Card contact chips** — in `ScheduledDetail` participants section: when participant has `card` populated from backend, show card chip (avatar + name, clickable → `/cards/:cardId/edit`). In `CardEditor` contacts section: show "N meetings" count chip per contact. (Requires backend P3.3 auto-linking to be built first.)

---

### P4 — Recurring Tasks UI

_(Already in Phase 3.2 P4 — carry forward)_

- [ ] **`TaskDetailPanel`:** Add "Repeat" field below Due Date. Dropdown: None / Daily / Weekly / Monthly / Custom. For Weekly: show day-of-week chip selector. Stores as RRULE string via `updateTask({ recurringRule })`. When task has recurringRule + isCompleted: show "Next occurrence: [date]" instead of struck-through title.

---

### P5 — Data Import UI

- [ ] **Contacts CSV import** — button in `CardEditor` contacts section: "Import from CSV". File picker → uploads to `POST /cards/:cardId/contacts/import`. Shows progress + result summary (`N contacts added, N skipped`).
- [ ] **Calendar .ics import** — button in Meetings page header: "Import from calendar". File picker → uploads to `POST /meetings/import/ics`. Shows how many meetings were created. Each imported meeting is a SCHEDULED type with no recording.

---

## Phase 4 — Big Brain ⛔ BLOCKED

- [ ] Global Ask AI / Big Brain chat interface (RAG — requires vector infra first)
